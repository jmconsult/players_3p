# Programming Exercise
# We need to create players.
# The players have a name, health, and a power
# The name is created using the following 3 lists:
# First Name: Super, Ultra, omni, Bati, Mega, Aqua
# Middle Name: Chayote, ChampiÃ±on, Tomate, Colifor, Rabano
# Last Name: Vengador, Nocturno, de las sombras, Tronador, Indestructible
# The Health is a random numeric value between 25-75 given at player creation time.
# The Power is the same.
# The maximum value for both Health and Power are 100 and the minimum is 0 When a player has a Power of 100 he is Maxed Out!
# When a player Health reach 0 the player is Dead.
# Each player has the following methods: woot and blam
# woot increases the player power by 10 without breaking the 100 maxed out value blam decreases the player health by 10 without getting below dead level of 0.
# Each player can print his status to the screen like this:

# The <player's name> has a Health of X and a Power of Y the current status is <normal | maxed out | dead>.
